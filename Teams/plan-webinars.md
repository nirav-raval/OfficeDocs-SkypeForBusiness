# Plan for Teams webinars

**APPLIES TO:** ![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)Meetings ![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png) Webinars ![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)Town halls

A webinar is a two-way interactive virtual event where the presenters deliver information to attendees. This format provides extra control for an organizer over the conversation and participants. Common scenarios for webinars might include trainings, product demos, sales lead generation, customer events, company announcements, and showcasing products. Webinars can accommodate up to 1,000 attendees and allow organizers to gather registration data from attendees before the event.

As an admin, this article guides you through how to plan and prepare for webinars in your organization.

## Turn webinars on or off

Webinars are enabled by default. If you'd like to disable or manage webinars for users in your organization, see [Manage who can schedule webinars](set-up-webinars.md).

## Understand your policies

A combination of admin meeting and event policies with organizer and attendee settings to manage webinars.

If you'd like to get familiar with how policies work for Teams meetings and events, see [Manage meeting and event policies in Microsoft Teams](meeting-policies-overview.md).

For a full list of admin policies and organizer settings for webinars, see the [Webinar control comparison](#webinar-control-comparison) section in this article.

## Decide the types of webinars that organizers can create

There are a few key differences between in-org and public webinars. When managing the event access type for webinars to decide whether organizers can schedule public webinars, consider the information in the following table:

|Capability|In-org webinar|Public webinar|
|:----|:-----:|:-------:|
|Includes guests|![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|
|Accessible to members of the organization that created the webinar|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|

|Anonymous users can register|![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|
|Attendees type their name on the registration form when registering|![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|
|Attendees must reenter their information after selecting the join link|![Image of a x for no](/office/media/icons/cancel-teams.png)|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|
|Attendees have unique join links|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|![Image of a checkmark for yes](/office/media/icons/success-teams.png)|

## Webinar attendee interaction

Registered attendees join the webinar with their cameras and mics off; webinar organizers choose when to let attendees turn on their cameras or unmute.

As an admin, you can manage the following features attendees use for interaction during webinars:

- **Chat:** You can set chat to be on for everyone, off for everyone, or on for everyone but anonymous users. When chat is set to **On for everyone**, all meeting and webinar participants can read and write chat messages; the organizer's **Meeting chat** settings control the chat experience.

- **Q&A**: You can manage which organizers can turn on Q&A for meetings and webinars.
- **Reactions and hand raise**: You can manage which organizers have reactions available for attendees to use during their meetings and webinars.

## Premium webinars

A Teams Premium subscription includes the following features for webinars:

|Feature name | Webinar features | Teams Premium webinar features |
